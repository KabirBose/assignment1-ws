        Hello there, my name is Kabir Bose. I am a student at Ontario Tech
        University studying IT and Network Security. I am currently in my second
        year. I love programming (mostly with JavaScript and Python), sports
        (mostly soccer and swimming), as well as playing video games! My
        favourite food is shawarma but tacos are a close second. I also love
        Batman and my favourite movie of all time is "Batman Begins".
        <br />
        <br />
        Here is my favourite clip from "Batman Begins"!
